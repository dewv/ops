# Recurring operations tasks	To schedule students for recurring tasks please have a manager or willing specialist open up a new calendar in Microsoft planner in your student one drive.


This document is used to schedule and track *proactive* operations tasks-- foreseeable work that recurs daily, weekly, monthly, etc.	Then have the manager use the different student email addresses to share the open and editable calendar. 


When you are scheduled to perform one of these tasks, create a new Issue in this repo (which counts as a GitHub contribution). Choose the new Issue template that corresponds to the task you are performing. The Issue template will provide you with instructions for the task.	Finally use the planners assign functions and the team emails to assign teammates to various tasks as you create them upon agreement by the team. 


## Weekly recurring tasks	These set tasks will then ping out to your student emails when nearing their due dates as well as start dates. Once a task is complete it can be checked off by plannerâ€™s completed functions.
