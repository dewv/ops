# Recurring operations tasks

To schedule students for recurring tasks please have a manager or willing specialist open up a new calendar in Microsoft planner in your student one drive.

Then have the manager use the different student email addresses to share the open and editable calendar. 

Finally use the planners assign functions and the team emails to assign teammates to various tasks as you create them upon agreement by the team. 

These set tasks will then ping out to your student emails when nearing their due dates as well as start dates. Once a task is complete it can be checked off by plannerâ€™s completed functions.
