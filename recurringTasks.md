# Recurring operations tasks

This document is used to schedule and track *proactive* operations tasks-- foreseeable work that recurs daily, weekly, monthly, etc.

When you are scheduled to perform one of these tasks, create a new Issue in this repo (which counts as a GitHub contribution). Choose the new Issue template that corresponds to the task you are performing. The Issue template will provide you with instructions for the task.
