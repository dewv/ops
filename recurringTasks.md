# Recurring operations tasks

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically create and assign Issues for recurring operations tasks. 

These proactive tasks include checking server logs, scanning for malware, and running security checks. Specific task instructions appear in each Issue.

When an Issue is assigned to you, you will be notified by email and/or Web alert, based on your GitHub preferences.
