# On-call rotation

Our Service Level Agreement (SLA) requires continuous support staffing during customer business hours: 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday. 

- When your shift starts, check the `help@dewv.net` mail inbox, and monitor it until your shift ends. Check the recent entries in the Duty Log below for any relevant information from the shift(s) preceding yours. Add an entry *to the top* of the Duty Log to generate a GitHub contribution, using `Report for duty` as the commit message.
- Respond to mail messages for new customer requests, using appropriate message templates ("signatures"). Templates include instructions for creating an Issue in this repo. At the same time, you should create a mailbox folder named `IssueX`, where `X` is the new Issue number.
- Respond to new mail messages about existing customer initiated Issues *if* they are urgent or it otherwise seems appropriate. If it does not require immediate attention, you may leave it for the Customer Service Communications process at our next staff meeting.
- When you respond to an incoming mail message, file it in the mailbox folder for the associated Issue. In other words, mail in the Inbox is mail that needs a response. *Do not leave it in the Inbox after you have responded to it.*
- You may use the mailbox's Reminders feature or the Duty Log below if you need to coordinate a response with the co-worker whose shift follows yours.
